            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The visualization “European Teens Are Drinking Less Alcohol” presents a choropleth map of Europe showing the percent decrease in teenage alcohol consumption 2002 vs. 2014, using an ombré color scale ranging from 0% to –32% and marking some countries as no data. At first glance, it is visually clear and aesthetic, showing large regions of Europe appearing in different shades of pink that suggest overall improvement. However, through Tufte’s idea of information resolution, the map is only moderately informative. It functions more as a high-level overview than a detailed explanation of what is changing, how much it matters, and what the audience should take away.</p>

            <h3>Ambiguous Definition</h3>
            <p>One of the limitations in the graphic’s resolution is the lack of definition of “teenage alcohol consumption.” The CNN article clearly identifies examples of drinking among teenagers as, “half of all teenage boys in England drank weekly in 2002, but this figure was down to one in 10 by 2014,” or “for teenage girls, the same number dropped from 43% in 2002 to 9% in 2014, with similar falls reported in Scotland and Wales.” The article also explains that, “across Europe, 28% of 15-year olds said they started drinking at age 13 or earlier, with boys more likely to start drinking early - but the figure was down from 46% in 2002.”The visualization uses the broad label, “teenage alcohol consumption,” without specifying whether it means weekly drinking, any drinking, early initiation, lifetime drunkenness, or another indicator. This is very important because the story and impact changes depending on which metric is used. A more detailed graphic would make the specific criteria being measured visible because without it, viewers cannot interpret what the percentages actually represent. </p>

            <h3>Lack of Baseline Context</h3>
            <p>The second resolution problem is that the visualization reports only the percent change, not the baseline rate. The article highlights the importance of baseline by talking about how, “England had scored second-worst in 2002 for the measure - but by 2014 the country was seventh-best,” and how “Croatia, Malta, Italy and Hungary saw the highest - with more than a quarter of boys in each country drinking weekly.” Those statements tell readers that a decline and low are not the same, and without baseline rates, viewers cannot accurately interpret whether reported changes reflect substantial progress or only movement relative to other countries. Also, the map design makes it difficult to see where teen drinking remains most common, because a large decrease can occur in a country that started extremely high, meaning two countries with the same percent decrease could still end at vastly different levels.  </p>

            <h3>Limited Measurability and Precision</h3>
            <p>The third resolution issue is measurability. The legend uses a smooth ombré gradient from 0% to –32% without clearly defined ranges or numeric values for individual countries. That design creates a quick assumption that the darker the color, the greater the decrease, but it prevents an accurate reading of the visualization. Viewers cannot easily extract exact numbers for specific countries or confidently compare similar shades, which limits the graphic’s usefulness and makes it difficult to verify, cite, or evaluate the evidence. </p>

            <h3>Missing Labels</h3>
            <p>Lastly, the map lacks country labels, which lowers interpretability for anyone who cannot confidently identify every country by shape. Because the purpose of an infographic is communication, not a geography check, leaving countries unlabeled forces some viewers to guess or have to do further research, undermining both comprehension and trust. </p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>The visualization also raises at least two of Tufte’s additional concerns. First, effects without causes. The map communicates the declines but removes the context included in the article. CNN includes competing causes, WHO emphasizes the “dangerously high” level of teenage drinking and the need to protect adolescents. While a UK charity representative argues the shift reflects how teens’ lives have changed and how social media makes “losing control” less appealing and claims it has “very little to do with policy,” noting alcohol remains cheap and available and that marketing targets young people. The visualization gives none of this context, so the decline can appear automatic or self-explanatory. </p>

            <h3>Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>Second, the graphic uses cherry-picking through its endpoint framing. By presenting only 2002 vs. 2014, it implies a clean trajectory while hiding year-to-year variation, potential plateaus, or reversals. CNN article calls it a “generational shift,” but the map alone cannot show whether that shift was steady or uneven, nor whether trends continued after 2014. It also cherry-picks a simplified summary of teen drinking while the article highlights multiple indicators that may not move identically across gender and country. </p>

            <h3>Overreaching<h3>
            <p>Finally, this visualization overreaches. The title infers a broad conclusion, “European Teens Are Drinking Less Alcohol,” while the article says that teenage drinking remains at a dangerously high level in Europe and highlights countries where levels are still high. Because the map omits baseline levels, precise values, and metric definitions, the conclusion goes beyond the data shown on the visualization. </p>
                
            </h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>A higher-resolution redesign would combine percent change with baseline rates, clarify the specific indicator being used, label countries, and provide contextual annotations. This visualization leaves viewers with an impression of clear and uniform progress that oversimplifies a complex and unrealistic reality. </p>
