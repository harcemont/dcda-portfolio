            <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>Before deciding on the Bad Drivers dataset, I found and tested multiple other datasets in Tableau and realized that several of them weren’t a good fit for creating clear or interesting visualizations. Many of them had key missing columns or variables that didn’t translate well into visualizations. I also noticed that certain datasets had either too broad or too detailed sections, which made it difficult for Tableau to easily group and visualize. Once I switched to the Bad Drivers dataset, I was able to successfully upload and create visualizations because of the clear columns and variables. I also relied on Tableau’s show me tab to give me a start on some of the visualization options I could use with my data. </p>

            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>I designed this lab around four Top 10 bar charts, each representing a different fatal collision-related factor. I chose bar charts because they are straightforward and ideal for ranking and comparing. Since the dataset is state-based, the clearest question I could answer visually was which states are highest for each crash factor? I filtered each chart to the top 10 states to avoid overwhelming viewers and to keep attention on the highest cases. This choice also supports the visual of highlighting patterns instead of having viewers scan all 50 states at once. I kept the formatting across charts the same and did all of the bars in pink, not only to have all of the graphs match, but also match my skills portfolio website. I also included a filled map as a contextual overview to understand how many fatal collisions per billion miles occurred in each state as a contextual overview. </p>

            <h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>I expected there to be more overlap where states would appear across different fatal collision type charts. I assumed that states with high percentages of speeding-related fatal crashes would also rank highly for alcohol impairment. Instead, the top 10 lists were much more mixed than I expected. For example, Hawaii appears very high for speeding (54%) and also appears in the alcohol-impaired top 10 (41%), but many other states shift dramatically depending on the factor. This shows that fatal crash risk isn't the same in every state for every category, but the highest states change depending on which behavior is being measured. </p>

            <h3>Surprises/Outliers</h3>
            <p>The biggest surprise was how different the top 10 lists were across categories, which challenges the assumption that high-risk states are the same in every category. Another surprise was how high the positive measures are. In the not distracted chart, the top 10 values were extremely high (96%-100%), and in the no previous accident history chart, the values were very similar (96%-100%). This made me wonder if these are all fatal crashes, why are so many drivers recorded as not distracted or having no prior accidents. Some outliers that stood out to me were District of Columbia at 100% for both not distracted and no prior accident history, and Mississippi at 100% no prior accident history. These outliers make me wonder about the sample size that was used and how these factors were defined. </p>

            <h3>Questions for Furhter Investigation</h3>
            <p>How were these factors defined when the data was collected? What counted as “speeding”, “alcohol-impaired”, “distracted”, and “no previous accidents”? Were the same definitions used consistently across all states?
            Are some states’ extreme percentages influenced by smaller sample sizes?
            Why does Hawaii rank high for both speeding and alcohol impairment? Could tourism, road type, or enforcement play a role?
            How do these percentages relate to the map of fatal collisions per billion miles? Do high percentages also correspond to higher overall fatality rates?</p>

            <h3>Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>I think that Tableau is very user-friendly especially because of the drag and drop feature. This made it very easy to experiment and test different visualizations easily. I also liked how simple it was to customize colors so the visuals could match my overall website design. A limitation is that Tableau doesn’t really provide suggestions or AI assistance the way tools like VS Code does, which I have found very helpful in other assignments for troubleshooting and improving my workflow. </p>
